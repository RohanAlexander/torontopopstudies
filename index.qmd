Welcome to the University of Toronto Population Studies Initiative. The TPSI aims to bring together researchers studying demographic and population issues across the university. We are an interdisciplinary group including affiliates from sociology, statistics, public health, social work, geography, and economics.

We host a regular seminar series. Please get in touch if you would like to be involved.
